The car, resembling a small, colorful version of a classic convertible, is equipped with parrot-friendly controls.

Polly Behind the Wheel:
Polly's driving sessions are a sight to behold. With a carrot clutched in his claw, he navigates around Parakeet's backyard, steering with beak and feet, much to the amusement of onlookers. "He's probably the only parrot in the world who drives for carrots," a neighbor comments.

Safety First:

A Local Sensation:
Polly has become a minor celebrity in Cityville, with people often stopping by to watch his driving escapades. "He's like our little superstar," says a group of children who regularly come to see Polly.
